# Digit-Recognizer-Project
This project aims to create and train a neural network model to recognize the numbers displayed in the given test images.
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision.Since its release in 1999,
This classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge,
MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
# Goal
In this Project, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. 
We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.
